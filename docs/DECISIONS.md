# DECISIONS — ICTS Europe Theme

Format: YYYY-MM-DD — Decision — Context — Consequences

2026-02-04 — Heading size slugs use h-1..h-6 — WP generates hyphenated CSS variables; aligning slugs and references prevents 16px fallback — Theme JSON and styles now consistent.

2026-02-04 — Added x-small and large font-size presets — CSS referenced these sizes; defining them avoids var() fallbacks — Editor and front end consistent.

2026-02-04 — Added color tokens base/main/secondary/tertiary/border-light — Patterns and CSS reference these tokens — Variables now resolve on front end and editor.

2026-02-04 — Renamed brand-terciary → brand-tertiary — Correct spelling and consistent naming — Audit content for old slug; add temporary alias if needed.

2026-02-04 — Standardized stylesheet handle (icts-europe) and moved inline CSS to wp_add_inline_style — Predictable enqueue and safer output — Dependencies can inline to this handle.

2026-02-05 — Hero Slider editor preview is CSS-only — JS preview caused instability in the editor — Preview shows first slide only and is view-only; editing remains stacked.

2026-02-05 — RTL support handled in slider CSS/JS — Polylang RTL pages need mirrored layout — Overlay gradient flips, content aligns right, indicators align right, and Flickity runs with rightToLeft.

2026-02-13 — Header utilities use scoped template-part CSS/JS — Header spacing, iconized search/language controls, and modal search behavior needed design parity without changing global button defaults — Header styles are isolated to `.icts-site-header`; search modal is handled by `assets/js/header-search-modal.js`.

2026-02-13 — Removed Custom HTML blocks from header template — Editors should manage the header with standard blocks only — Search trigger and language icon are now styled via scoped CSS, and modal markup is rendered via `wp_footer` in `functions.php`.

2026-02-13 — Replaced front-end Polylang select with custom language popover — Native `<select>` styling was too limited for design parity and RTL control — Theme now intercepts `polylang/language-switcher` output on front end via `render_block`, using `pll_the_languages( raw )` data plus custom JS/CSS; editor block workflow remains unchanged.

2026-02-13 — Moved header container spacing/border from block inline styles to scoped CSS — Inline block styles forced repeated `!important` overrides across breakpoints — Header defaults now live in `assets/styles/core-template-part.css`, which reduces `!important` usage and makes responsive changes cleaner.

2026-02-15 — Added native Solutions Slider block pair — Needed a page-width locked, editor-friendly slider with hero-style timer indicators and reusable Flickity setup — New `icts-europe/solutions-slider` + `icts-europe/solutions-slide` blocks ship with custom editor UI, front-end autoplay indicators, and constrained responsive styling.

2026-02-15 — Added decorative animated strands to Solutions Slider wrapper — Needed an initial branded motif matching XD style without adding plugin/code complexity — Implemented lightweight SVG-based pseudo-elements with reduced-motion and mobile/editor fallbacks; can be swapped for final XD-exported strand SVG later.

2026-02-15 — Switched Solutions Slider strands to static (no motion) — Animated motion did not meet design preference — Strands remain as decorative SVG pseudo-elements with the same placement and responsive/editor fallbacks.

2026-02-16 — Team Member single template uses a two-column profile+sidebar block layout — Needed a usable baseline for CPT singles with discoverability of adjacent profiles and cleaner social treatment — `acf/team-member-profile` now renders profile content plus an "other team members" sidebar, with LinkedIn icon output only when the ACF URL exists and brand-tertiary hover transition.

2026-02-16 — Registered Team Member profile UI strings with Polylang and switched block output to `pll__()` fallback — Needed direct per-language editing in Polylang String Translations for labels like "Leadership Team" — Strings now appear under `Theme: Team Member`, while untranslated sites still use theme textdomain defaults.

2026-02-16 — Enqueued Team Member profile stylesheet in block editor and added editor-specific preview polish — Single template preview looked inconsistent in Site Editor — `assets/styles/blocks/team-member-profile.css` is now loaded in editor and includes scoped preview layout rules.

2026-02-16 — Overrode Yoast Team Member archive SEO title/schema naming to remove "Archive" — Default Yoast archive template produced "Management Team Archive - …" in title/OG/schema — Theme now filters Yoast title/OG/Twitter/schema for `team-member` archives to output "Management Team - Site Name", with Polylang-aware label translation.

2026-02-16 — Team Member archive H1 is translated via Polylang string mapping — Block template heading text is static HTML, so direct `__()` output is not available in template markup — Theme now registers `management_team_page_heading` and swaps the archive H1 block text at render time for `team-member` archive requests.

2026-02-18 — Added FAQ Accordion ACF block with taxonomy scoping, schema output, and RTL-safe interactions — Needed a reusable front-end FAQ surface that can be reused across pages/languages with consistent SEO markup — New `acf/faq-accordion` block renders language-scoped FAQ queries, supports optional fixed Product/Customer Type scoping per page, outputs FAQPage JSON-LD per block instance, and keeps all accordion items closed by default with subtle open/close animation.

2026-02-20 — Added reusable Counter ACF block with lightweight viewport-triggered JS animation — CSS-only integer animation support is inconsistent across target browsers — New `acf/counter` block supports number/direction/label/prefix/suffix controls, renders with semi-transparent brand-primary background + radius, and animates reliably using IntersectionObserver + requestAnimationFrame with reduced-motion handling.

2026-02-20 — Added `x-large` typography token and updated counter presentation defaults — Counter labels needed a larger semantic size token and consistent affix rendering — Theme now exposes `--wp--preset--font-size--x-large`, counter labels use it at 700 weight, counter background is 70% brand-primary transparency, and row/column spacing behavior is normalized for counter blocks.

2026-02-20 — Added `brand-primary-light` token and applied it to counters — Needed a lighter branded counter treatment while keeping reusable card behavior in editor layouts — Counter cards now use 70% transparent `brand-primary-light`, and counter blocks stretch to equal height when used inside Row/Grid/Columns containers.

2026-02-20 — Added reusable Counter Band pattern and container-aware counter typography — Counter cards needed a predictable full-width section wrapper and better handling of large values in narrow cards — New `icts-europe/counter-band` pattern provides a background-image band with responsive counter grid, and counter value sizing now scales by card width to prevent overflow.

2026-02-22 — Made Hero/Solutions native blocks translation-safe by sourcing translatable fields from saved HTML — Polylang/DeepL translations changed visible text while unsourced attributes still held original values, triggering block validation errors — Hero CTA label/URL/target and Solutions intro heading/subheading now parse from block markup, reducing “unexpected or invalid content” on translated pages.

2026-02-22 — Upgraded native Hero/Solutions block registrations to `apiVersion: 3` — WordPress 6.9 warns on API v1/v2 custom blocks for iframe editor compatibility — Theme-owned JS blocks now align with current block API expectations; plugin-owned warnings remain external.

2026-02-22 — Added inspector preview toggles and restored Solutions strands in editor — Preview mode needed a reliable way to exit in Site Editor and design parity required visible strands while editing — Hero/Solutions sliders now expose `Preview first slide only` in inspector, preview no longer suppresses all interactions, and Solutions decorative strands are rendered in editor.

2026-02-23 — Scoped editor-only slider CSS for iframe editor compatibility — After moving native blocks to `apiVersion: 3`, editor canvas rules keyed to `.block-editor-page` no longer matched reliably inside iframe contexts — Hero/Solutions preview and strands editor rules now target both `.block-editor-page` and `.editor-styles-wrapper`, and preview-hide logic uses sibling selectors so only non-first slides are hidden.

2026-02-23 — Versioned Hero editor stylesheet by filemtime — Theme-version cache keys delayed editor CSS updates during rapid block iteration — Hero editor styles now invalidate immediately after file edits, matching other block/editor asset versioning.

2026-02-23 — Added nested navigation flyouts and hierarchical mobile submenu drawers — Industries/Solutions/Company now require second-level submenu flyouts on desktop and parent-aware drawer navigation on mobile — Desktop child flyouts open horizontally from the main mega panel with mirrored RTL positioning, and mobile Back now returns to the immediate parent panel instead of jumping to root.

2026-02-27 — Enabled class-based submenu icons in mobile navigation drawers — Icon classes (`nav-icon-*`) were already used for desktop mega menu rows and needed parity in mobile for consistent IA cues — Mobile drawer row content/toggles now render the same mask-based icon pseudo-elements, so one menu item class setup works across desktop and mobile.

2026-02-27 — Standardized desktop third-level flyout placement and prevented submenu label wrapping — Deeper menu drawers must remain predictable as editors add more nested links under Industries/Solutions — Third-level flyouts now always anchor to a fixed right-side column from the first submenu panel, and submenu labels use no-wrap styling to avoid broken line wraps at narrower desktop widths.

2026-02-27 — Enabled Polylang `Custom fields` synchronization for FSE translation workflows — Header/navigation and other block-based translated entities were not consistently duplicating/copying related metadata during language creation — Keeping `Languages → Settings → Synchronization → Custom fields` enabled is now a required project setting to support reliable translated menu/template behavior.

2026-02-27 — Enabled editor margin/padding controls via theme settings with spacing token guardrails — Editors needed per-block spacing controls (margin/padding) without opening unrestricted custom values — `settings.appearanceTools` is now enabled and `settings.spacing.margin/padding` are true, while `customSpacingSize` remains false so spacing remains token-based.

2026-02-27 — Scoped flow-spacing resets for Hero Slider, Solutions Slider, and Counter Band wrappers — Enabling global margin/padding tools exposed inherited flow spacing side effects on full-width custom blocks — Added targeted wrapper-level `margin-block` resets in block CSS so those components keep their intended geometry while editor spacing tools remain enabled globally.

2026-02-27 — Aligned global button typography with header CTA baseline — Header navigation CTA intentionally uses smaller, regular-weight button text and other buttons should visually match by default — `styles.elements.button` now uses `font-size: small` and regular weight token in `theme.json`, while keeping existing button padding values.

2026-02-27 — Implemented new native Sector Grid/Sector Card blocks using no-build JS + plain CSS assets — Theme’s existing native block pipeline registers browser-ready scripts from `assets/blocks/*` and styles from `assets/styles/blocks/*` without SCSS compilation — New blocks follow the same runtime pattern and are registered via `register_block_type_from_metadata`.

2026-02-27 — Tuned Sector Grid/Card editor controls for predictable content design — Editors requested fewer container spacing overrides plus flexible card typography controls — Sector Grid now relies on default spacing (no custom spacing controls) and exposes core layout/grid controls, while Sector Card now supports heading element switching (`h2`–`h6`/`p`) and configurable heading/body font size and weight.

2026-02-27 — Constrained Sector Card font-size controls to theme preset tokens — Free-text size inputs were too open-ended for editor consistency — Heading/body font size controls now use preset dropdowns (theme token slugs), with frontend mapping to `--wp--preset--font-size--*` variables and backward compatibility for existing legacy values.

2026-02-27 — Locked Sector Grid container layout to grid-only defaults — Editors should not switch card container layout types and break card alignment patterns — Sector Grid now disables layout editing/switching at container level, defaults to `type: grid`, and sets default `minimumColumnWidth` to `20rem` while preserving child grid item positioning controls.

2026-02-27 — Expanded Sector Card modal authoring controls — Modal body composition needed to be less restrictive and card-level visual treatment needed configurable modal surfaces — Removed modal InnerBlocks allowlist (layout/content blocks now unrestricted) and added per-card modal background color setting rendered on the frontend modal panel.

2026-02-27 — Added Sector Card modal starter layout actions — Editors needed faster modal authoring with reusable structures instead of building every modal from scratch — Sector Card editor now provides one-click modal templates (`Simple`, `2 Column`, `Feature List`) that replace modal InnerBlocks content with structured starter blocks.

2026-02-27 — Restricted Sector Card modal background control to theme palette tokens — Modal visuals should remain on-brand and avoid arbitrary ad hoc colors — Modal background now uses a theme-color slug selector only (no free color picker), with default set to `brand-primary-hover` and frontend rendering through `--wp--preset--color--{slug}`.

2026-03-02 — Added native How It Works timeline block pair with interactive step rail — Product pages need an editable, reusable 3-step process component before final design handoff — New `icts/how-it-works` + `icts/how-it-works-step` blocks provide editor-managed heading/intro/steps and front-end click+keyboard step activation with progressive timeline rail styling.

2026-03-02 — Added optional `Horizontal Stepper` style variation for How It Works — Needed a second visual option before final design delivery without changing content model — `icts/how-it-works` now exposes a block style variation that switches timeline rail/panel layout to a desktop horizontal presentation while keeping existing mobile behavior.
