# TODO — ICTS Europe Theme

- [ ] Add temporary alias palette entry `brand-terciary` for one release, or migrate content to `brand-tertiary`.
- [ ] Align `style.css` headers with README (WP/PHP/License URL) and bump version.
- [ ] Add `languages/` and generate POT file for `icts-europe`.
- [ ] Centralize vendor asset registration (Flickity) and reuse handles.
- [ ] Consider a pause control for hero slider (ARIA) if autoplay remains.

## Editor UX
- [ ] Lock down patterns/templates: hide unused ones for editors and expose only the curated set.

## Deployment
- [ ] Prep staging (dev.ies.aero): document deploy steps and enable ShortPixel + WebP on staging.

## Accessibility
- [ ] Slider sweep: keyboard focus order, contrast on indicators/buttons, and reduced‑motion behavior (ticker/autoplay off or paused by default when prefers-reduced-motion).
