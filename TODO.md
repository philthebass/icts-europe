# TODO — ICTS Europe Theme

- [ ] Add temporary alias palette entry `brand-terciary` for one release, or migrate content to `brand-tertiary`.
- [ ] Align `style.css` headers with README (WP/PHP/License URL) and bump version.
- [ ] Add `languages/` and generate POT file for `icts-europe`.
- [ ] Centralize vendor asset registration (Flickity) and reuse handles.
- [ ] Consider a pause control for hero slider (ARIA) if autoplay remains.

## Multilingual
- [ ] Verify Team archive slug translations: in Polylang → Strings, ensure `team_member_archive_slug` ("management-team") has the desired slug per language (en_GB, es_ES, fr_FR, nl_NL, pt_BR, pt_PT, ar, zh_CN, zh_HK) or keep English; then visit Settings → Permalinks to flush and confirm each archive URL resolves.
